### Documetation Development

Documentation is written in markdown files in the docs directory. 

You can learn more about the Markdown syntax [here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/about-writing-and-formatting-on-github)

MkDocs is installed in the virtual environment, so you can run a live server for previewing the docs in your browser:

mkdocs serve

```
